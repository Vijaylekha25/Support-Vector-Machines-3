    "Answer-In order to predict house prices based on several characteristics, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., the best regression metric to employ would likely be Mean Squared Error (MSE). MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It provides a good indication of how close the predicted house prices are to the actual prices across the dataset."

    "Answer- If the goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, Mean Squared Error (MSE) would be more appropriate as the evaluation metric.

    "Answer-In a dataset with a significant number of outliers, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) would be the most appropriate regression metric to use with an SVM model. MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE because it calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. This makes it more robust in scenarios where outliers can significantly affect the model's performance."

    "Answer- If both Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values are very close, it is generally preferable to choose RMSE as the evaluation metric. RMSE has the advantage of being in the same unit as the target variable (in this case, house prices), making it easier to interpret compared to MSE, which is in squared units. Additionally, RMSE is more sensitive to large errors due to the square root operation, which can be beneficial for identifying and addressing significant prediction errors."
